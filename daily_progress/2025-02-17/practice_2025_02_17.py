Most countries use the metric system for recipe measurement, but American bakers use a different system. For example, they use fluid ounces to measure liquids instead of milliliters (ml).

So you need to convert recipe units to your local measuring system!

For example, 8 fluid ounces of milk is {8*29.5735:.2f} ml. 
And 100ml of water is {100 / 29.5735} fluid ounces.
